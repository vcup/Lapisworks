- You can have four arms now (procrastination slain)
  - Your third and fourth arms can auto-cast 20x a second  
    Both must be devoted to auto-cast, but one can hold something (e.g. Focus, Amel-tuned Orb, etc.)
  - Your third and fourth arms can hold items
  - You may swap arms 1-2 with 3-4, and use them with mouse4-5 (yes mouse4 and mouse5, rebindable)
  - They can also do macro-work for you
  - bro tip for luxof: manningham mills lets you fuck with enums
- End overhaul
  - the ender dragon bossfight is fun now (pool adding this to its pack is a secondary motivation)
  - there are new structures
  - lore
- Entity Construction
  - make a vessel
  - flay entities into it to get their AI
  - customize it's body and mind
- If not already done, every plausibly Lapisworks-y thing from "hm"

# 1.7.0
LAPISWORKS IS ON BOTH FORGE AND FABRIC NOW. (is this even required?) (i mean Dryym should be able to play the mod right)

clairvoyance (future-seeing)  
noophaestus interop  
hexcasting media display interop  
iotic blocks interop  

possible interop:  
- hexical
  - give conjured color the ability to take mage block effects
  - Make AVM staff as a variant of sorts of Hexical's Lightning Rod Staff
    - affix items to it
    - enchant it to make the fixations permanent
    - when enchanted, it uses the item as a power like in AVM  
  - also add gloves with Hexical 2.0.0. they'll be two-handed charms that take half a second to clap.
- hexcassettes? (`for i in range(n): enqueue(spell, tick_delay)`-like pattern?)
- Hexpose interop
  - spell to remove a status effect from the entity that has it
    - negative effects take power^2*time_multiplier dust to remove the status effect
    - positive effects take power^3*time_multiplier dust to remove the status effect
- hexchanting
  - modify the existing items to have spellbook-like functionality!
  - "i'm applying everything i've learned" or something
  - i'd hate to add superior stuff with amel infusion..
  - i don't want people downloading hexchanting just because of lapisworks
  - what do i do?
- complexhex
  - add qubits to hex casting (this is useless lmao)
- hexmachina
  - "i got 47 more rounds in this 6 barrel shotgun" ahh idea search
  - I CAN ADD FUCKING GUN TURRETS
    - YOU HAVE TO CONTROL THEM BY HEX
- slate works
  - make a loci that enhances cleric ambit around player to chalk circle levels!
    - costs amel
  - Gemini Directrix
- ephemera
- hexdeco
- heartxxy
  - uhhh???
  - instant adult-ification spell, i guess?
  - like the counterpart to Hastenature, i mean
  - but Nurture exists tho...
~~- scryglass~~  
  ~~- add the ability to unfocus your mouse~~  
  ~~- add buttons~~  
  ~~- add text inputs?~~  
- that scryglass idea is all of HexIntent
- hexxyskies interop
  - ship variant of the jumpslate that jumps to the nearest ship in the specified radius
  - wisp-ify a ship by imbuing a simple mind into it
    - unlocks spells for fine-tuned ship movement?
    - Nah, executes spells on physics ticks

much bigger phials  
~~ability to extend pattern and stack limit by expending media~~ gave that to hexthings  
  nvm hexthings threw it right back to me (infeasible for it)  
  0.01 dust per iota per pattern (meaning it stays that extended for that many patterns)  
  nvm oneironaut has it
~~computers lmao~~  
~~- slab that you can use Craft Artifact on~~  
~~- you can send iotas to computers with a spell (which costs more the longer the distance)~~  
~~- sending iotas chunkloads~~  
~~- has ambit over itself and the adjacent blocks~~  
~~- casts on block update and iota sent~~  
hexboxes (complexhex(?)) and casting engines (hexic) do it better,  
no need to add wisp communication to it  

KING CRIMSON (so what part, exactly, of this is Lapisworks-y?)  
(P.S. even Miyu didn't want to do this. Are we deaduzz, chat?)
- select area and time
- area continues as normal for time
- now those entities (including players) are locked in to that movement
  - to prevent others from interfering use either an invisible barrier or do the same for around that area
    (but prevent caster from going there)
- caster is not locked in to that movement  

port twokai's ideal condition  
~~port hexxy dimensions~~ pool and scepticake took it  
Ra's Gambit
- think up something motherfucker
- this name is way too fucking cool not to use!  
- oh, makes embedding extremely easy!
Gene Editing (as an extension of the 4-arm-getting system) and Entity Creation
- making yourself a vampire is possible  


~~enchanted amethyst~~  
~~- not the first time i've thought about it, maybe see where it goes~~  
that's called Amel you buffoon  

COOL WIZARD DRIP  

~~backdrawn patterns~~
~~- free exquisite idea no one's done before, like per world pattern shapes~~  
~~  probably equally painful~~  
~~  this time the pain isn't in hexdoc, but in inline etc.!  ~~  
~~  fun for the whole family~~  
~~- fix inline~~  
~~- modify pattern drawing?~~  
~~- there's an UncheckedHexPattern(? not sure if that's the name) now, use it~~  
~~- might need a diff pattern iota to match it to stuff in a separate registry?~~  
~~  - actually maybe mixin to PatternRegistryManifest (bro getting flooded)~~  
~~- inverted color in book and grid + end of drawing to represent backstroke visually~~  
~~- to represent it, the letter is "s"~~  
Miyu's april fools addon took it  

zone dstl projectile  

JIT compilation
- not sure if i can do this or if it'd even be worth it
- it would be very funny if i did add this though lmao
- also is a novel idea no one's added yet similar to PW pattern shapes
- reduce lag on cube eval hexes for example
- basically:
  - interpret the code of the pattern list
  - turn it into effects (hard-coded)
  - if there is an unsupported pattern, fail JIT
  - if this succeeds, the code just executes a bunch of effects now with the stack like a map
  - optimize stuff
    - Explode, Fireball, give effect, take away effect -> explode, fireball, incur cost
    - Raycast mantra raycast block stack manip raycast architect =
        (many) -> (many, block (from archer) + face (from architect)) =
        raycast to block + face

make the addon more hexxy
- "mechanics should fit into Hex Casting like legos, combinable with other stuff and robust"  
  (paraphrased from Lani)  

per world pattern shapes picking between a few handmade ones is boring..  
add some randomness!  

jumpslate across space and time  
-# i don't even do drugs. what does this mean, past me?  

- vv only if no one else is interested  
  - MASSIVE multi-block wizard towers! give you ambit + cost reduction + grid size
    (grid size toggleable)  

trinket that casts upon dropped (so like death and shit)  
shift right click to prime/unprime  
right click to throw (when primed)

trinket that stops GTP item spillage and makes it half as cheap  
- "enderman's monocle"
- rub some amethyst dust on an eye of ender, then put it in an amel-iron-diamond case  

~~a trinket that shows a config screen for hexes it's primed to work for! it'll show~~
~~pre-configured-for-hex iotas and let you select their values, with a default value already present  ~~
Too late. HexIntent has that now.

TODO:  
- Hex familiar that lets you interact with the Media Condensing Network at a range.
  - floating entity. like Terraria's flying piggy bank? or maybe just a wisp?
  - bind it to one linkable and it'll do all it's business with that one linkable
    - this linkable is it's entrypoint into any network, basically
    - can't make it auto-search for the nearest one because it needs to be not OP
  - you may now pull from that by rmb on the pet with a phial (attempts to fill whole phial)
  - you may also push to that by shift+rmb on the pet with a phial (attempts to drain whole phial)
  - costs about 2 amel per 32 blocks of distance (so free within 32 blocks)
  - i think it should be some kind of orb with a :3 face on it?
  - summon the pet via wearing a necklace for a minute
    - make it exclusive with the focus necklace :>
- Mind Control of entities in the game  
  (reality check: gang, how lost are we in the sauce?)
  - you have to un-flay with a Simple Mind first
  - you gain a "controllable" iota from the un-flaying.
    - in-lore, this is a set of mappings for what brain points do what, what makes the entity
      tick basically and also IO points for stuff (to store info for example)
    - in the event that you lose this iota, there is a pattern to get it from an entity
      that was un-flayed by you. this costs about a shard of amethyst
  - controllable movement
  - Deposit Media can be used to recharge a controllable
  - media limit of 64 dust
  - cannot overcast
  - credits to Sheppo from the Hex Casting discord server for these
    - they can be pets
    - VERY small ambit, at most 3 blocks and usually just 1 (by default too)
    - can have pre-set conditions to cast a hex, e.g. on hurt (so kind of like Hierophantics!)
      - not Sheppo: can only have one condition (in-lore: too much space occupied by condition and hex)
- Rote Brewery
  - Infuse a Simple Mind into a Brewing Stand
  - Can remember up to 5 potion recipes
  - Each write is permanent, stops brewing anything but remembered potions when at the limit
  - When a potion from memory is selected, takes items automatically.
  - Brewing a recipe it doesn't know is a pain as each step takes twice as long.
  - Brewing a recipe it DOES know has normal speed, but reduced ingredient cost.
    - cost reduction = 20% chance not to consume the ingredient being used  

potions!
  - potions of shine and dim
    - enable and disable the enchanted texture effect via pouring over an item
    - "pouring" is a shapeless crafting recipe with the item and the potion
  - chorus fruit potion
    - causes teleportation all over the place?
  - ender pearl potion
    - teleports you to where you consumed it after the effect runs out
    - milk bypasses teleportation
    - you can just. keep. adding redstone to make it longer
    - gives you Chaos when it teleports you, paralyzing you for a few seconds (like Terraria)  

so you know about the Ultra Instinct beam effect when Goku first achieves it right  
do that but for the chalk multiblock  
invert the color of the world inside the beam (shader)  
make it spin  
make it rectangular like a beacon's  
make it play a cool ass sound effect  
all that jazz  

put all this time shit in an addon  
call it Hex To The Future  

Hastenature is AOE now (and perhaps has a duration for which it boosts random tick rates?)  

FUCKING UNICORNS
  - IMBUE A SIMPLE MIND INTO A HORSE AND USE 64 AMEL
  - After being made, a Unicorn develops an affinity for you (and so is bound to you).
  - You can only have one Unicorn bound to you (any attempts to make more fail).
  - Unicorns are uncommonly seen, however they do appear around the player from time to time.  
    They VERY rarely spawn during the night.
  - Unicorns have a zone of influence around themselves with a radius of 32 blocks.
  - No hostile mobs can spawn in the presence of a unicorn, and any that spawn outside it's zone  
    of influence refuse to enter said zone of influence.
  - No patterns can execute within the zone of influence of a Unicorn, mishapping instead.  
  - see that one convo i had with Miyu (search up Tulpa on TechTastic)

wearable cypher/trinket/artifact trinket  
enchanted flowers?  

Slate Imprinter? Kind of obsolete since you can make it with foci neckli but uh why not?  

Lightningbending rework
- Hold a stance
- In this stance you are very likely to get hit by lightning
- Enchantment levels:
  - 1 = very likely to get hit by lightning in thunderstorms
  - 2 = instant hit in thunderstorms, likely in rain
  - 3 = instant hit in rain, likely in clear weather
  - 4 = instant hit always
- If you are hit with any lightning you redirect it where you're looking
- Yes, sideways lightning.  
  - past me, fuck yourself.
